User Authentication and Authorization: The system should allow authorized users, such as healthcare providers and insurance personnel, to securely access and interact with the system. User roles and permissions should be defined to control access to sensitive information.
Claim Submission: Authorized users should be able to submit healthcare claims electronically. The system should support various types of claims, including medical, dental, and vision, and validate the submitted data for accuracy and completeness.
Claim Processing: The system should process submitted claims efficiently and accurately. It should verify patient eligibility, coverage details, and provider credentials. Additionally, it should perform coding validations, such as ICD-10 and CPT codes, to ensure compliance with billing standards.
Adjudication Rules: The system should apply adjudication rules to determine the adjudication outcome for each claim. These rules may include coverage limitations, fee schedules, medical policies, and contractual agreements between insurers and providers.
Claim Adjudication: Once adjudication rules are applied, the system should calculate the amount payable by the insurer and generate an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) for the patient. It should also handle claim adjustments, denials, and appeals in accordance with regulatory requirements.
Payment Processing: The system should facilitate payment processing for approved claims. It should generate payment vouchers, initiate electronic fund transfers, and maintain a record of payment transactions for auditing purposes.
Reporting and Analytics: The system should provide reporting and analytics capabilities to track claim processing metrics, monitor claim trends, and identify areas for process improvement. Users should be able to generate standard reports and customize reports based on specific criteria.
Compliance and Security: The system should comply with healthcare regulations, such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI). It should implement robust security measures, such as data encryption and access controls, to safeguard sensitive data from unauthorized access or disclosure.
