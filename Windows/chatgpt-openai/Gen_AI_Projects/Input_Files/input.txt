The login page should be the first page that users see in the modified application. It should provide two text fields
- one for entering a login name and one for entering a password. In addition it should have a command button that
initiates the password checking action. If either of the text fields is left blank it is an error that must be reported to the user. If both fields are filled in but there is no record of the user name or the password is
incorrect that must also be reported to the user. Users that have not yet registered cannot log in. They must first
register by clicking on the register command button. They should be able to do this without getting an error for an
empty name or password field.
When the login command button is clicked without filling in the name field or without filling in the password 
field the user should see error messages. When the login command button is clicked after 
filling in the name field password fields but the name is unknown or the password is incorrect the user should 
see an error message. Even when the user has filled in both fields the password field 
should be blank after an incorrect login (the getter for the password property always returns an empty string). 
The implementation shown above handled the name property the same way, but a friendlier implementation would show the 
login name as it was entered before clicking the login command button. Then the user would not have to enter it again 
unless they saw that it was incorrect. The registration page should be displayed when a user clicks on the register 
command button in the login page. It should provide three text fields - one for entering a login name and two for 
entering passwords. In addition it should have a command button that initiates the registration action.
If any of the text fields is left blank it is an error that must be reported to the user. If all fields are filled in 
but there is already a record for the user name then that must be reported as an error. If the two passwords are 
different that must also be reported as an error. When the register command button is clicked without filling in the 
name field or without filling in both password fields the user should see error messages. 
Both passwords field should be blank after this error but the login name may be visible. When the user attempts to 
register with a login name that is already taken the user should see an error message.
