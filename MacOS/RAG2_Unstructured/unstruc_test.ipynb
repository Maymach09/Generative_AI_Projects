      "NARRATIVETEXT: The Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) document will help you choose a health plan. The SBC shows you how you and the plan would share the cost for covered health care services. NOTE: Information about the cost of this plan (called the premium) will be provided separately. This is only a summary. For more information about your coverage, or to get a copy of the complete terms of coverage, [insert contact information]. For general definitions of common terms, such as allowed amount, balance billing, coinsurance, copayment, deductible, provider, or other underlined terms see the Glossary. You can view the Glossary at www.[insert].com or call 1-800-[insert] to request a copy.\n",

      "NARRATIVETEXT: What is the overall deductible?\n",
      "NARRATIVETEXT: Answers $500/Individual or $1,000/family Generally, you must pay all of the costs from providers up to the deductible amount before this plan begins to pay. If you have other family members on the policy, they have to meet their own individual deductible until the overall family deductible amount has been met.\n",
      "TITLE: Why This Matters:\n",
      "NARRATIVETEXT: Are there services covered before you meet your deductible?\n",
      "NARRATIVETEXT: Yes. Preventive care and primary care services are covered before you meet your deductible.\n",
      "NARRATIVETEXT: This plan covers some items and services even if you haven’t yet met the annual deductible amount. But a copayment or coinsurance may apply. For example, this plan covers certain preventive services without cost-sharing and before you meet your deductible. See a list of covered preventive services at https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/.\n"
