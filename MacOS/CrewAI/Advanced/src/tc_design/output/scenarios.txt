## Test Scenarios for Claims Adjudication System:

**1. Rule Configuration and Management:**

* **Scenario 1.1:**  Define a new rule for eligibility based on patient age. Verify that the rule is correctly applied during claim adjudication.
* **Scenario 1.2:**  Create a complex rule set with multiple conditions and nested logic. Ensure the system correctly interprets and applies the rule set.
* **Scenario 1.3:** Update an existing rule to change the benefit coverage for a specific procedure. Verify the updated rule is reflected in subsequent claim adjudications.
* **Scenario 1.4:**  Test the system's ability to handle conflicting rules and prioritize them based on defined hierarchy.
* **Scenario 1.5:**  Verify that rule changes are properly documented and auditable.

**2. Fraud Detection:**

* **Scenario 2.1:**  Submit a claim with suspicious patterns (e.g., multiple claims from the same provider for the same patient in a short period). Verify that the system flags the claim for review.
* **Scenario 2.2:**  Test the system's ability to identify claims with potential fraudulent billing codes.
* **Scenario 2.3:**  Simulate a scenario where a user attempts to manipulate claim data to commit fraud. Verify that the system detects and logs the attempt.
* **Scenario 2.4:**  Test the tools for investigating and managing fraudulent claims. Ensure the system provides sufficient information and tracking capabilities.

**3. Claims Adjustment:**

* **Scenario 3.1:**  Submit a claim that requires adjustment due to new information (e.g., updated patient eligibility). Verify that the system allows for the adjustment and maintains an audit trail.
* **Scenario 3.2:**  Test the process for handling claim appeals. Verify that the system records the appeal, allows for review, and updates the claim status accordingly.
* **Scenario 3.3:**  Ensure that all adjustments made to claims are properly documented and auditable.

**4. Integration with Financial Systems:**

* **Scenario 4.1:**  Submit a claim that triggers payment processing. Verify that the system seamlessly integrates with the financial system and initiates payment.
* **Scenario 4.2:**  Test the system's ability to handle different payment methods (e.g., direct deposit, check).
* **Scenario 4.3:**  Verify that the system accurately records all financial transactions related to claims.

**5. User Access Management:**

* **Scenario 5.1:**  Test the system's role-based access control. Verify that users with different roles have appropriate permissions and cannot access restricted data or functions.
* **Scenario 5.2:**  Simulate a scenario where a user attempts to access data or perform actions outside their authorized permissions. Verify that the system prevents unauthorized access and logs the attempt.
* **Scenario 5.3:**  Test the system's ability to track user activity and generate detailed logs for auditing and compliance purposes.

**6. System Configuration:**

* **Scenario 6.1:**  Test the tools for configuring system settings, adjudication rules, and user roles. Verify that the system allows for easy configuration and updates.
* **Scenario 6.2:**  Simulate a scenario where business requirements or regulations change. Verify that the system can be easily adapted to accommodate the changes.
* **Scenario 6.3:**  Test the system's ability to handle different configurations and settings.

**7. Data Security:**

* **Scenario 7.1:**  Test the system's security measures to protect sensitive patient and claims data. Verify that the system encrypts data at rest and in transit.
* **Scenario 7.2:**  Simulate an attempt to access the system unauthorized. Verify that the system prevents unauthorized access and logs the attempt.
* **Scenario 7.3:**  Verify that the system complies with relevant regulations such as HIPAA.
