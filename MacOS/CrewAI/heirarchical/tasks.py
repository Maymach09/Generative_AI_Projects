            A detailed test plan document with the following sections:
                1	Introduction:
                    ◦	Purpose: Explain the objectives of the test plan.
                    ◦	Scope: Define what is included and excluded from the testing activities.
                2	Test Strategy:
                    ◦	Approach: Describe the overall strategy for testing, such as types of testing (functional, non-functional), levels of testing (unit, integration, system, acceptance), and techniques used.
                    ◦	Entry and Exit Criteria: Define the conditions that must be met before testing can begin (entry criteria) and when testing is considered complete (exit criteria).
                3	Test Deliverables:
                    ◦	List all documents, reports, and artifacts that will be produced during the testing process (e.g., test cases, test scripts, test logs, defect reports).
                4	Test Environment:
                    ◦	Hardware: Specify the hardware requirements for testing (servers, workstations, mobile devices).
                    ◦	Software: Specify the software requirements (operating systems, databases, browsers, other tools).
                    ◦	Tools: List any testing tools or automation frameworks that will be used.
                5	Testing Schedule:
                    ◦	Provide a timeline for testing activities, including milestones, key dates (start and end dates of each phase), and dependencies on other activities.
                6	Roles and Responsibilities:
                    ◦	Define the roles of team members involved in testing (test manager, testers, developers), along with their responsibilities and authority.
                7	Test Cases:
                    ◦	Detail the specific test cases or scenarios to be executed, including inputs, expected outputs, and any preconditions or assumptions.
                8	Risk and Mitigation:
                    ◦	Identify potential risks to the testing process or the project as a whole. Include a plan for how these risks will be mitigated or managed.
                9	Assumptions and Dependencies:
                    ◦	Document any assumptions made during the test planning phase and dependencies on other teams, resources, or external factors.
                10	Approvals:
                    ◦	Specify who needs to review and approve the test plan before testing can commence (e.g., project manager, stakeholders).
                11	Change Management:
                    ◦	Describe how changes to the test plan will be handled, including the process for updating the plan and communicating changes to stakeholders.
                12	Testing Metrics:
                    ◦	Outline the metrics that will be used to measure the progress and effectiveness of testing (e.g., test coverage, defect density, pass/fail rates).
