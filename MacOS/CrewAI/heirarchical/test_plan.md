* **Test Case Preconditions:** The system is set up and configured for scalability testing.
* **Test Case Steps:**
    * Increase the number of users and data volume gradually.
    * Monitor the system's performance and resource utilization.
* **Test Case Expected Results:** The system scales efficiently to handle increasing user loads and data volumes without significant performance degradation.
* **Test Case Actual Results:** [Record the actual results]
* **Test Case Pass/Fail:** [Mark as Pass or Fail]
* **Test Case Comments:** [Add any relevant comments]

**8. Risk and Mitigation**

* **Risk:** Delay in access to test environment.
* **Mitigation:** Secure access to the test environment as early as possible.
* **Risk:** Insufficient test data.
* **Mitigation:** Create realistic test data sets to cover various scenarios.
* **Risk:** Lack of communication between development and testing teams.
* **Mitigation:** Establish clear communication channels and regular meetings.

**9. Assumptions and Dependencies**

* **Assumption:** The SRS document is complete and accurate.
* **Assumption:** The test environment will be available as per the schedule.
* **Assumption:** The development team will provide necessary support and bug fixes.
* **Dependency:** Completion of development of all features as defined in the SRS document.
* **Dependency:** Availability of test data.

**10. Approvals**

* **Project Manager:** [Name]
* **Stakeholders:** [List stakeholders]

**11. Change Management**

* Any changes to the test plan will be documented and communicated to all stakeholders.
* The test plan will be updated regularly to reflect any changes to the system or testing requirements.

**12. Testing Metrics**

* **Test Coverage:** The percentage of code covered by test cases.
* **Defect Density:** The number of defects found per line of code.
* **Pass/Fail Rates:** The percentage of test cases that pass or fail.
* **Time to Resolution:** The average time it takes to resolve defects.

**Note:** This is a sample test plan and should be adapted based on the specific requirements of the Day Health Manager Version 1.1. You should add more specific test cases based on the details provided in the SRS document.
