**6. Test Execution**

The test cases will be executed by the testing team. The team will follow the test plan and document all test results.

**7. Reporting**

The testing team will generate a test report that summarizes the test results. The report will include:

* A list of all test cases executed.
* The results of each test case.
* Any defects or issues identified.
* Recommendations for further testing.

**8. Test Closure**

The test plan will be closed when all test cases have been executed and all defects have been resolved.

**9. Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Test Manager:** Responsible for overall test planning and execution.
* **Test Lead:** Responsible for leading the testing team and ensuring that all test cases are executed.
* **Testers:** Responsible for executing test cases and reporting defects.

**10. Risks and Mitigation**

* **Risk:** Insufficient time for testing.
* **Mitigation:** Prioritize test cases and focus on critical functionalities.
* **Risk:** Lack of access to test environment.
